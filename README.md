# Konoma React Components

To be used in any of our React based projects where we do not want to use a 3rd party ui library.

## Development

Clone this repository into a directory of your choice. Make changes as needed. run `yarn build`. To directly use the result in a local project, add "@konoma-development/react-components": "file:/path/to/this/repo" to your package.json dependencies. Remember to replace this with a proper version once development is complete.
